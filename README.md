dice-python
===========

A Python library for rolling dice.

Out of all the dice rolling semantics that exist today on the various
platforms, none of them are generally accepted as the definitive standard for
expressing dice rolls for virtual gaming. The closest (at least most
ubiquitous) form is that defined by [OpenRPG](https://www.assembla.com/spaces/openrpg/wiki)
which has seen use and modification in a number of applications.

This library represents both an implementation of a "standard" means of
rolling dice, as well as a basis for publishing an accompanying document that
will describe fully the grammar and syntax in hopes of establishing a
standard.
